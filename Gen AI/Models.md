## 2. Overview of Models

### 2.1 Gemini 1.5 Pro

Gemini 1.5 Pro is part of Google’s Gemini family of multimodal AI models capable of handling both textual and visual inputs. As a powerful successor to Bard and earlier PaLM-based models, it can process images, generate natural language responses, and perform basic reasoning across modalities.

**Key Features:**
- Handles image and text inputs jointly
- Faster and lighter than Gemini 2.5
- Suitable for simple vision-language tasks
- Publicly available on platforms like Google Colab via API

### 2.2 Gemini 2.5 Pro

Gemini 2.5 Pro is a more recent and powerful model with enhanced multimodal reasoning, better grounding in visual tasks, and significantly improved alignment with prompt instructions.

**Key Features:**
- Higher accuracy and reliability in visual classification
- Stronger reasoning and explanation generation
- Better understanding of structured prompts
- More robust against ambiguous or atypical inputs

## 3. Why These Models Were Used

The objective of the project was to evaluate the ability of modern vision-language models to perform **grain type classification** using image inputs. Gemini 1.5 and 2.5 were selected for the following reasons:

| Reason                          | Gemini 1.5                    | Gemini 2.5                    |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Multimodal capabilities         | Yes                           | Yes                           |
| Accessible via Python API       | Yes                           | Yes                           |
| Good for comparison baseline    | Yes (earlier version)         | Yes (latest version)          |
| Prompt-following performance    | Moderate                      | Strong                        |
| Resource efficiency             | More lightweight              | More accurate but heavier     |

Using both allowed us to **compare performance across generations** and assess how well modern LLMs improve in structured vision tasks when paired with well-designed prompts.
