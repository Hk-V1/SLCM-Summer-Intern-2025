# Strategy 2: LLaMA Vision + Doctr for Weighbridge Slip Data Extraction

## Goal
Combine **Doctr (OCR)** for raw text extraction with **LLaMA Vision** for intelligent understanding and field mapping. This enhances accuracy by using vision-language reasoning.

---

## Workflow
1. **Image Input**: Capture/upload weighbridge slip photo.
2. **OCR Stage**: Doctr extracts raw text from the slip.
3. **Vision-Language Analysis**: LLaMA Vision analyzes slip layout, validates OCR results, and interprets ambiguous fields.
4. **Field Mapping**: LLaMA Vision aligns values (e.g., “Net Weight” → correct field even if mislabeled).
5. **Output**: Structured, validated dataset.

## Pros
- Better accuracy than OCR-only.
- Handles **different slip layouts** and noisy backgrounds.
- Performs **contextual validation** (e.g., cross-checks gross – tare = net).
- Open-source, customizable pipeline.

## Cons
- Higher compute requirements (GPU recommended).
- Latency increases compared to OCR-only.
- More complex integration (OCR + vision model).
- May require fine-tuning for industry-specific formats.
