# AI-Powered Weighbridge Slip Data Extraction

## Goal
Automate extraction of key fields (vehicle number, gross/tare/net weight, date, etc.) from weighbridge slips using AI-based approaches.

## Strategies Overview

| **Strategy** | **Approach** | **Pros** | **Cons** | **Best For** |
|--------------|--------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **1. Doctr (OCR only)** | Simple OCR-based extraction | Lightweight, fast, runs on CPU, easy to deploy | Struggles with low-quality images, limited field understanding | Small deployments, clean & consistent slip formats |
| **2. LLaMA Vision + Doctr** | OCR + Vision-Language Model for reasoning | Higher accuracy, layout flexibility, contextual validation | Needs GPU, slower than OCR-only, more complex integration | Mid-scale deployments, varied slip designs |
| **3. Doctr + Qwen2.5 Vision** | OCR + Strong multimodal reasoning | Most accurate, strong error correction, multilingual, robust to noise | Highest compute cost, complex architecture, higher latency | Large-scale enterprise use, mission-critical accuracy |

---

## Recommendation

- For **pilot projects or small setups** → **Strategy 1 (Doctr)** is sufficient.  
- For **scalable but balanced solutions** → **Strategy 2 (LLaMA Vision + Doctr)** offers the best trade-off between accuracy and cost.  
- For **enterprise-grade, high-stakes operations** → **Strategy 3 (Doctr + Qwen2.5 Vision)** is the **best overall choice**, ensuring the highest accuracy, robustness, and reasoning capabilities, though at a higher compute cost.

## Final Suggestion
If long-term **accuracy and robustness** are critical (e.g., financial audits, compliance, multi-site deployments), choose **Strategy 3 (Doctr + Qwen2.5 Vision)**.  
If you need a **cost-effective starting point**, begin with **Strategy 1** and scale up to **Strategy 2 or 3** as requirements grow.
