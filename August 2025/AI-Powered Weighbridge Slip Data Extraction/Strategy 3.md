# Strategy 3: Doctr + Qwen2.5 Vision for Weighbridge Slip Data Extraction

## Goal
Leverage **Doctr OCR** for text detection and **Qwen 2.5 Vision** (strong multimodal model) for robust interpretation, reasoning, and error correction in weighbridge slip data extraction.

---

## Workflow
1. **Image Input**: Capture/upload weighbridge slip photo.
2. **OCR Stage**: Doctr extracts text.
3. **Multimodal Reasoning**: Qwen2.5 Vision analyzes both extracted text and original slip image for alignment.
4. **Validation & Error Correction**:
   - Detects OCR errors (e.g., “8” misread as “B”).
   - Uses reasoning to check weight logic (gross ≥ net + tare).
   - Handles multilingual slips if required.
5. **Output**: Highly accurate structured dataset.

---

## Pros
- **Most accurate** of all strategies.
- Strong **reasoning and error correction**.
- Robust against varied formats, noisy/blurred slips.
- Supports **multilingual and multimodal contexts**.
- Ideal for enterprise-scale deployment.

## Cons
- Highest compute cost (GPU strongly required).
- More complex system architecture.
- Latency higher than other strategies.
- May require prompt engineering or fine-tuning for domain use.
