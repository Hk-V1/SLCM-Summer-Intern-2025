# Strategy 1: Simple Doctr for Weighbridge Slip Data Extraction

## Goal
To build a lightweight OCR-based system using **Doctr (Document Text Recognition)** for extracting text data from weighbridge slips (e.g., vehicle number, gross weight, tare weight, net weight, date).

---

## Workflow
1. **Image Input**: Capture/upload weighbridge slip photo (JPEG/PDF).
2. **Preprocessing**: Apply resizing, denoising, thresholding.
3. **Text Extraction**: Use Doctr OCR to detect and recognize text.
4. **Field Mapping**: Match extracted text to structured fields (regex/patterns).
5. **Output**: Store in structured format (JSON/CSV/Database).

## Pros
- Simple and lightweight deployment.
- Fast extraction for clean, high-quality slips.
- Works on CPUs with minimal resource requirements.
- Easy to integrate with existing systems.

## Cons
- Struggles with **low-quality images** (blur, shadows).
- Limited **field understanding** (needs regex/manual mapping).
- No multimodal reasoning (cannot validate context visually).
- Performance drops with varied slip formats.
