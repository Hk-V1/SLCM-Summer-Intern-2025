# LLaMA 4 – Overview, Models, and Applications

## 1. Introduction

**LLaMA** (Large Language Model Meta AI) is Meta’s family of foundation models. The latest major release, **LLaMA 4**, debuted in 2025 and brings several leaps forward over its predecessors:
- Introduces **multimodal** (text + images) capabilities.
- Built on a **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture for efficiency.
- Offers historically large **context windows** capable of handling long inputs.

## 2. LLaMA 4 Model Variants

| **Model Name** | **Total Parameters** | **Active Parameters** | **Experts** | **Context Window** | **Key Highlights** |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Scout**      | 109 B               | 17 B                 | 16          | 10 M tokens        | Extremely long context, efficient multimodal handling |
| **Maverick**   | 400 B               | 17 B                 | 128         | 1 M tokens         | High-capacity tasks, codistilled from Behemoth |
| **Behemoth**   | ~2 T                | 288 B                | –           | –                  | Largest variant, still in training as of release |

**Architecture**: MoE design activates only a fraction of the total parameters for efficiency, enabling a lightweight yet powerful inference process.  
**Multimodal Input**: Handles both images and text, enabling applications such as visual question answering, captioning, and image-grounded reasoning.  
**Multilingual Capability**: Natively supports multiple languages with broad pretraining coverage.

## 3. Use Cases & Applications

### 3.1 Long-Context Processing
- **Scout’s 10M tokens** context window allows analysis of very long documents—books, entire code repositories, or multi-page reports.  
- **Maverick** handles substantial inputs (up to 1M tokens), ideal for extended code bases or long-form reasoning.  

### 3.2 Multimodal Applications
- Visual reasoning, captioning, and answering questions about images.  
- A strong fit for chatbots that process both text and visuals.  

### 3.3 Enterprise-Grade Generative AI
- Available via cloud platforms for secure, scalable deployment.  
- Ideal for document summarization, customer support, and knowledge assistants.  

### 3.4 Research & Fine-Tuning
- Suitable for academic research and domain-specific model tuning.  
- Supports fine-tuning methods like LoRA and QLoRA for lightweight adaptation.  

### 3.5 Open-Source Accessibility
- Meta’s open licensing enables broad experimentation and accessibility.  
- Useful for startups and developers needing cost-effective AI solutions.

## 4. Real-World Limitations

- Developer feedback has criticized LLaMA 4 for underwhelming benchmark performance compared to rivals.  
- Lacks advanced features like strong reasoning, agentic capabilities, and tool calling.  
- Still valued for **practical, cost-effective** enterprise use—especially in summarization, code generation, and email drafting.

## 5. Future Outlook

- Meta’s new **TBD Lab**, part of its Superintelligence Labs, is working on advanced successors to LLaMA 4 (internally referred to as “LLaMA 4.5” or “LLaMA 4.X”).  
- These efforts signal continued development toward more capable, reasoning-oriented models.
