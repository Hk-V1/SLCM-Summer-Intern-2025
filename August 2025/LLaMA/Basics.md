# LLaMA Models – Overview, Comparison & Applications

## 1. Introduction to LLaMA  
**LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)** is a family of open-source foundation models developed by **Meta AI**. These models are optimized for efficiency, requiring fewer resources than traditional large models, while still delivering competitive performance.  

LLaMA models are widely used for:  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks  
- Conversational AI  
- Code generation  
- Research in interpretability & fine-tuning

## 2. Comparison of LLaMA Models

| **Model Name** | **Types / Variants** | **Primary Use Cases** | **GPU Requirements** |
|----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| **LLaMA 1** (2023) | 7B, 13B, 33B, 65B | Research baseline, NLP tasks, text generation | 7B/13B: 1×A100 (40GB), 65B: 8×A100 (80GB) |
| **LLaMA 2** (2023) | 7B, 13B, 70B <br> (Pretrained + Chat) | General NLP, chatbots, enterprise AI, reasoning | 7B: 1×A100 (40GB), 13B: 2×A100, 70B: 8×A100 (80GB) |
| **Code LLaMA** (2023) | 7B, 13B, 34B | Code generation, debugging, software engineering tasks | 7B: 1×A100, 34B: 4–8×A100 |
| **LLaMA 3** (expected 2025) | (Rumored) 8B, 70B, 140B | Next-gen NLP, multimodal capabilities, enterprise-grade assistants | Likely requires multiple H100 or A100 GPUs depending on size |
